# Decision log

Decisions about how this AI setup works, newest first. Each entry records what was decided, why, and when to revisit. Detailed evidence lives in `research/radar/`. Add an entry whenever a choice is made, and don't rewrite old entries: supersede them with a new one.

## Open items

- [x] **Live-test the hooks** (done 2026-10-28): WebSearch from the main thread was denied, and an Agent spawn without brief sections was denied. SessionStart injection was confirmed earlier the same day.
- [ ] **CodeGraph trial on Cannaville (UE5).** Ask the same 2–3 architecture questions with and without CodeGraph, and compare token use in `ccusage session`. Decide Adopt or Hold.
- [x] **Build research playbooks:** `purchase-research`, `tech-howto`, `fact-check` (written 2026-10-28).
- [ ] **Test `purchase-research` and `tech-howto`** with one realistic example each (one researcher per test). `fact-check` is already tested.
- [ ] **Build `health-evidence`**, together with a `health-coach` plugin.
- [ ] **Usage review around 2026-11-28:** run `ccusage daily` and `ccusage monthly`, then tune model and effort assignments.
- [ ] Later: `game-research`, `stack-selection`, `market-research`, and an `agent-architect` skill. Then the pre-production pipeline, kept separate from a per-feature spec/ADR development loop.

## 2026-10-28: Research playbooks as skills in the research plugin
**Decision.** `purchase-research`, `tech-howto`, and `fact-check` are skills in the `research` plugin. Each defaults to one `web-researcher`, and deep mode runs only when the user asks, after a quota warning. Descriptions include Turkish trigger phrases so they fire on Turkish requests. Each skill ships its own delegation brief and a Turkish output template.
- `purchase-research`: asks need and budget first. Checks measured reviews and long-term owner complaints separately, plus failure points, same-price alternatives, Turkey price (Akakçe/Cimri), and Turkey warranty. Outputs a decision matrix and who should or should not buy.
- `tech-howto`: pins the exact version first, prefers official docs, vets community scripts, and gives a backup and rollback per step. It never runs state-changing commands unasked.
- `fact-check`: SIFT method, claim split into parts, traced to the original. Verdicts: doğru / yanıltıcı / yanlış / doğrulanamadı.

**Test result (`fact-check`, claim "humans use 10% of the brain").** One researcher returned a report that fit the brief: per-part verdicts, original-source trail, and an honest "Not verified" list. Weak spots: it leaned on Wikipedia for the origin trail, did not read the primary texts, and found no Teyit or Doğruluk Payı check. If this repeats, add an explicit step to search teyit.org directly and to read the primary source before settling an origin claim.
**Why.** These are the recurring research jobs in the open-items list, and a playbook per job keeps source standards consistent while the quota stays low.
**Revisit.** After testing `purchase-research` and `tech-howto`.

## 2026-10-28: Model and effort per kind of work
**Decision.** Fable is not used: on the Pro plan it bills usage credits.

| Work | Model | Effort |
| :- | :- | :- |
| Development conversations (brainstorm, plan, implement) | `opusplan`: Opus 5.5 in plan mode, Sonnet 5.5 while executing | medium. Use high for architecture and pre-production decisions |
| Health conversations | Opus 5.5 | high |
| Quick questions, small edits, general chat | Sonnet 5.5 | low or medium |
| `research:web-researcher` subagent | `sonnet` (set in the agent file) | medium |
| Bulk lookups and file sweeps (ad hoc subagents) | `haiku` | low |

**Note.** The desktop app's model picker rejects `opusplan` ("unsupported model"). It only works in the CLI (`claude --model opusplan`). In the desktop app, do the same thing by hand: use Opus 5.5 while brainstorming and planning, and switch to Sonnet 5.5 in the picker once the plan is approved.
**Why.** Opus reasons best and is the Pro default, but it uses quota fastest. `opusplan` puts Opus where judgment matters (planning) and Sonnet where volume is (execution). Health conversations are rare, and careful reasoning matters more there than cost.
**Revisit.** At the usage review, using ccusage data.

## 2026-10-28: Usage tracking with ccusage
**Decision.** `ccusage` is installed globally through npm. It reads local Claude Code logs, and the old Antigravity logs too.
**Why.** It shows per-day, per-model, and per-session token use, which is the data needed to tune model and effort choices. Cost columns are API-equivalent prices, not Pro charges. Use them to compare, not as a bill.

## 2026-10-28: Code intelligence and memory tools
**Decision.** The built-in tools are the default (agentic search, CLAUDE.md, auto-memory, and in-repo spec/ADR docs). CodeGraph goes to Trial on the UE5 project only. Serena is Assess, not installed. `mcp-memory-service` is Hold: it is not migrated from Antigravity.
**Why.** See [radar entry](../research/radar/2026-10-28-code-intelligence-and-memory.md).
**Revisit.** 2027-01-28, or after the CodeGraph trial.

## 2026-10-28: Where memory and decisions live
**Decision.** There are three layers:
- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`: a short profile and working style, loaded in every session.
- This file: setup decisions and open items, versioned and public.
- Obsidian vault: personal data (health) only.

Claude's auto-memory is a per-folder convenience, not the source of truth.
**Why.** Conversations and per-folder memory disappear when sessions are deleted. Git history doesn't, and CLAUDE.md loads automatically.

## 2026-10-28: Enforcement through hooks, not capitalized rules
**Decision.** Mandatory behavior is enforced by hooks in the plugins. Subagent briefs need `<objective>`, `<context>`, `<done_when>`, and `<output_format>`. WebSearch runs only inside subagents. Both policies are re-injected at session start and after every compaction.
**Why.** Instruction-only rules fade in long sessions. Hooks run as code, so the model cannot skip them.

## 2026-10-28: Research is quota-aware
**Decision.** `ai-engineering-radar` defaults to quick mode: one researcher. Deep mode (2–4 parallel researchers) runs only on request, or when a decision is expensive to reverse.
**Why.** The Pro plan quota. The quick-mode radar used about 67k subagent tokens, while a 4-agent fan-out costs roughly 4×.

## 2026-10-28: New repo, Antigravity setup retired
**Decision.** `RaijuMounun/ai-playbook` (public) replaces the archived `RaijuMounun/skills`. The Antigravity prompts are rewritten from scratch, not ported.
**Why.** The old prompts relied on simulated mechanisms ("run DSPy compilation") and on capitalized rules. Claude 5 models follow plain, reasoned instructions better. A full backup of the old repo and the Cannaville-studio files is in `C:\Users\Eren\.gemini\config\_archive`.
